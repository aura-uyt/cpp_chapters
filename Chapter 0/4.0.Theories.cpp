// There are 2 types of HEADER FILES:-
// 1) System Header Files: these are predefined header files which comes with compiler,, List of this is @cpp_reference.com_Header_files
#include<iostream>      // <iostream> here is a System Haeder file, whcih contains different codes for the funtion of Program
// User Defined Header Files: these are written by user, they are in "____.h" format,
//                            if in the currect directory there is file named "code.h" and there are some rules/ codes wriiten in it,
//                            then those codes/rules would be inlcuded and Applied here if written #include<code.h>
#include"4.code.h"      // This is user defined Header file,, this will follow Codes that i wrote on "4.code.h"

 // Arithmetic Operators

     cout<<"The value of a != b is: "<< (a!=b) <<endl;

 // Logical Operators
